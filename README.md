# Iris-Dataset-Classifier
The Iris dataset has long been a go-to for machine learning enthusiasts, but I wanted to take it a step further by adding a visual twist! Instead of working with the standard dataset, I built an Advanced Iris Image Classifier that accepts real images of Iris flowers and classifies them using a combination of computer vision and machine learning.
